# Hit-Ball

Welcome to Hit-Ball, a thrilling multiplayer game crafted with Roblox Studio!

## Overview
Hit Ball is an exciting game where players engage in a fast-paced challenge of hitting a ball that accelerates with each hit, eventually reaching speeds of up to 100 km/h! But here's the catch - you're not just aiming to hit the ball; you're also outsmarting other players by tricking them into making mistakes and missing the ball.

## Gameplay
In Hit-Ball, your objective is simple: keep hitting the ball while avoiding getting tricked by your opponents. As the ball speeds up, your reflexes and strategic thinking will be put to the test. Each player starts with 3 lives, and losing all lives means you're out of the game. But don't worry, you can always jump back into the action by joining a new game filled with fresh competitors!
